<h1>Brand Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>UrWebsite provides the creation of personalized websites to small budgeted businesses in an affordable environment with an accommodating voice, helping them feel stress free and better well known. </p>

    <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>I will use the following color:<span id="maroon"></span>  alongside <span id="blueish"></span>. <br>One is darker and one is much lighter. <br>These 2 compliment each other nicely to give a proffesional, affordable and welcoming feel to it. This is the feeling i want the user to experience.</p>

    <h2>Icons</h2>
        <p>I would use icons such as this one<span id="icon">q</span> so the user can see clearly where my contact number is.</p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>This is a very important element as it catches the users attention immediately, so it must fit the feel i am trying to give the user. I would use appropriate photos and adjust the lighting to be not so bright, so it is comfortable for the eye to look at and doesnt put the user off. They would be slightly focused as well so that the user can sense the message the image is giving across.
        </p>

    <h2>Textures and shapes</h2>
        <p>I would consider using subtle textures on the nav or header to give the site a more interesting and exciting look.The perspective would also be altered to fit my feel, e.g. some text would seem bit further away then other paragraphs....
        As for shapes, I would not make any rounded corners as I want the feel to be neat, orderly and proffessional.</p>

    <h2>Fonts, font-sizes,vertical spacing</h2>
        <p>I would use  </p> <span id="header">this font for the main paragraphs on the page. It is a clear font, easy to read when the paragraph is long.</span>
         For the text I want to stand out such as the header: <span id="fancy-text">I would use this font.</span>As it is intersting and differentiaites between the header and main info on the rest of the page.

    <h2>Language  styles</h2>
        <p>I would use a proffessional but warm tone. Of course correct spelling and punctuation is crucial. If any lists were included, i would use bullet points, as this is clear and neat.</p>
