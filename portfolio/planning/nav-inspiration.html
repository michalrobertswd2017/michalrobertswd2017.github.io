        <p> I like the nav on this page particularly because of its positioning.
            It is very simple to use and clearly laid out. It is inviting and gives a warm feeling.
            I would customize it by altering it slightly to suit my website style. The font and font size would be different, less formal and a bit warmer to make it more inviting. </p>

        <p>The nav on this page is also nice and attractive. I like it because it is elegant and approachable. It makes the user want to find out more and click on the subheadings in the nav. It draws you into the website. I would customize it by making the options in the nav more spread out. I would put fewer options, leaving some to go in the footer. </p>

        <p>As this is a website for a men's store, it obviously will differ substantially from my portfolio website, however i just picked this as a good example of a drop down nav. I like this style of nav as it succeeds in condesing a lot of information and organising it in an orderly way. The user will be able to find what is required easily. If I would use this nav it would be quite different as I don't have as many categories and sub-categories as they do. It would be neater as well.</p>
