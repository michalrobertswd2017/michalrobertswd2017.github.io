        <h2>Brand mission statement summary</h2>

            </p>
        <h2>colors</h2>
            <p>I will use this color <span id="blueish"></span> and this:<span id="orange"></span> to give a brightish kind of feel, but also not too bright. I would maybe put a lighter overlay on.</p>

        <h2>icons</h2>
            <p>the only icons i would use would be contact icons such as <span id="icon">q</span>and one for comments <span id="icon">b</span>.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
            <p>The following images are child therapy related and would be appropriate to include:<img src="therapy1.jpeg">
            <img src="therapy2.jpeg"> <img src= blocks.jpeg><img src=puppets.jpeg></p>

        <h2>Textures</h2>
            <p> i would consider including this as texture:<img src="concrete-wall-2.png">.</p>

        <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p><span id="main">I would use this font for the main</span> <span id="headings">and this one for the heading/s.</span>  </p>

        <h2>Language styles</h2>
            <p>The tone would be proffessional yet simple. Giving over the message that the parent can be confident enough in this therapist to send his child to her. It would sound caring and nurturing.</p>
