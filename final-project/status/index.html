I have found a client!

Her name is Ariella Levy and her occupation is a play therapist.
I am in touch with her to discuss her vision and ask all the necessary questions.

I am in ongoing contact with my client Mrs Levy. I have asked her many detailed questions so I can get an idea of what service she provides, who she caters for, her goals etc. This is helping me to get a picture of her users and therefore how i should create the website, to meet their expectations. She is very flexible and is often available so I can be in touch with her when neccessary, ask her important questions, get more information, or whatever I need.

I have been in touch with my client through email about various details. She first sent me a whole load of information and the next day changed her mind entirely. I then had to call her and we spoke for a long time discussing a completly new idea. She sent me links to other websites and told me what she wans her site to look like. We discussed her aims, goals and challenges. She already has a site which has some information but she wants me to do a new site, from scratch.
