I have found a client!

Her name is Ariella Levy and her occupation is a play therapist.
I am in touch with her to discuss her vision and ask all the necessary questions.

I am in ongoing contact with my client Mrs Levy. I have asked her many detailed questions so I can get an idea of what service she provides, who she caters for, her goals etc. This is helping me to get a picture of her users and therefore how i should create the website, to meet their expectations. She is very flexible and is often available so I can be in touch with her when neccessary, ask her important questions, get more information, or whatever I need.
